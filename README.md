# My Portfolio Website (Work in Progress)

This is my personal portfolio site, built to showcase my work as a front-end developer and software engineer.  

Right now this project is under active development — I’m iterating on layout, styling, and features. Once it’s complete, it will be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) under a custom domain.
